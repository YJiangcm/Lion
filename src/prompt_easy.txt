I want you to act as a Prompt Creator.
Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Prompt# to create a brand new prompt.
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Given Prompt# but be even rarer.
The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Prompt# should be similar to that of the #Given Prompt#.
The #Created Prompt# must be reasonable and must be understood and responded by humans.
'#Given Prompt#', '#Created Prompt#', 'given prompt' and 'created prompt' are not allowed to appear in #Created Prompt#.

#Given Prompt#:
